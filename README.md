# speech-recognition-service
Production ready speech recognition API, implemented in major protocols: REST, grpc, webrtc, websocket, MQTT

The problem with speech recognition service is that almost all SOTA models in research is not production-ready, while the pricing for service on the market (from major providers such as AssemblyAI, DeepGram, AWS, Azure,...) is quite expensive. This repo will try to close the gap and make speech recogntion accessible for developers. 


I will borrow idea from these repositories:\
vosk-server: https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-server \
whisper: https://github.com/openai/whisper \
whisper-cpp: https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp \ 

Services provided by AssemblyAI, this repo will try to include all:\
